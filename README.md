## General info
This project is a remake of my Higher or Lower mobile app, created using the new .NET Maui framework.

The original application is a simple guessing game, where the app asks the user to guess a number between 1 - 50, 
the user has 5 lives and once the lives are used or the correct number is given the game restarts with a new random number between 1 - 50
